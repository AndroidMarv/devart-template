# Getting our hands on Node.js
As mentioned in the previous post, one part of the Wishing Wall is a server. Since node.js is a great solution for a web server and it is in javascript, we decided to go for it. And in this way, we can have the majority of our code written in javascript.

A breakdown of things that needs to be done for Wishing Wall:
1. install Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
2. install and connect MongoDB (database is needed for storing wishes and users, http://www.mongodb.org/)
3. cookies for keeping sessions (we did with expressjs.com/)
4. websockets for receiving new wishes -> socket.io library
5. layout of received wishes (advance rendering of tables: pagination, search, sortering)

![Node table view](../project_images/node3.png?raw=true "Table view")
6. sentiment analysis of a wish (https://github.com/thinkroth/Sentimental)
7. add Web Speech API to store wishes in database
8. authentificaation though google API (http://passportjs.org/)
![Authentification](../project_images/node1.png?raw=true "Authentification")
9. create different roles for users and also different views (administrator rights, normal user)
10. statistic of active users/visitors (to know the web traffic load)
11. handling errors 404 and 403
